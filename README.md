# cpp1_ResistorsWithOutArrays

**Resistor Calculator**

**Usage:**
1. Compile and run the program.
2. Choose your connection type:
   - Type 1 for Series Connection
   - Type 2 for Parallel Connection
3. Input the number of resistors.
4. Provide resistance values for each resistor.

The program uses optimized loops to efficiently gather resistor values and perform necessary calculations.

if-else conditions to handle different connection types (Series or Parallel) and performs resistance calculations accordingly.

Type casting to ensure precise calculations and proper unit representation, enhancing the accuracy of the final resistance value.
